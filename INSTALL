You need to create on the drupal side
1) a project node type (that is an OG group) and that contains a cck field integer "case" (used to store the case's id in civicrm)
2) an issue node type (that can be published in the OG group and that contains a cck field integer "activity" (used to store the activity id)

if you want to change the names, copy this file in your sites/settings.php and modify accordingly
civicrm_timetracker.default.settings.php

and on civicrm, two types of activity types: Issue (for the issues) and timelog (err. for the timelog more on that later)
and a case type project
and relationship

cd /your/civicrm

php bin/csv/import  -u user -p password -s yoursite.org RelationshipType /var/www/civi.custom/civicrm_timetracker/config/relationship.csv
php bin/csv/import  -u user -p password -s yoursite.org OptionValue /var/www/civi.custom/civicrm_timetracker/config/optionvalue.csv
