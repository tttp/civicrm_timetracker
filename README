Tracking "agile" projects can be split into two parts
1) discussing features, commenting, reporting bugs. This is the communication part, and we use drupal and the wonderful og_mailinglist for that. It might be interresting to use open attrium as well (and patch welcome...).

2) tracking time spent on issues and "high level" reporting. 
We have selected civicrm as this is mostly about contacts and activities.
The only "trick" is that we are using a field in civicrm_activity that isn't exposed currently in the current civicrm standard interface (as of 4.0): id_parent, so we can have a relationship between the time log and their parent activity.


So on the drupal front Project (or sub project) have a cck "civicrm_case" (int)
Issues have a cck "civicrm_activity" (int)


On the civicrm side of things

Each activity has a type, we create two

- "task", where the duration is the expected duration
- "timelog" with id_parent set to task where the duration is the time spend by the task batch.

So if "home page layout" is the task you'll have subtasks time log "did the css sprite" with duration 2 hours on monday morning, "modified header" with duration 1 hour tue at 2pm...

TODO:
adding a hook so when you create a node project or activity, it creates a case/activity
adding a (jqgrid based ?) interface to easily log the time spent
develop that feature on miss moneypenny
